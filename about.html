						<br>Directly downloaded from Youtube, following the Subreddit reports, we edited the uncontrolled content in order to convey, in a more clear way, this mysterious, yet well defined, iter Elsagate videos follow.
						<br>To present our series we needed a language that rhymed with the problem, without being as unrestrained as the content itself,
						which is already <span class="pop-text-1">extremely frightening</span>.
						<br>We decided to tone it a little bit down by adding light references to childhood,
						summed up by <span class="pop-text-1">stickers buttons and tickets frames</span>, along with an interactive navigation that allows the user to discover the <span class="pop-text-1">different layers</span> our project consists of.

							With the project <span id="trigger-1_1" class="pop-text" data-pop-text-out data-pop-media="media1">"the Tube Trap"</span>we focused on Youtube’s content farm, especially on those contents addressed to kids,
								where we found recursive patterns across the published videos (e.g. same rhymes, images and videos formats), along with the dangerous Elsagate phenomenon.
								<br><br> We pushed our <span id="trigger-1" class="pop-text" data-pop-text-out data-pop-media="media2">research</span> a little bit further, a little bit further, aiming at making parents’ aware of this really subtle and mostly unknown phenomenon their kids may encounter whilst spending time on YouTube.
								<br>To do so we created four short experimental and <span id="trigger-4" class="pop-text" data-pop-text-out data-pop-media="media3">intentionally shocking videos</span> to visually explain how this phenomenon appears and works on YouTube.
								<br><br> All the material arranged for the videos comes from Youtube.

					<h1 class="subtitle-about-b d-flex justify-content align-self">But how did we find such inappropriate material? </h1>
					<p class="txt-about-b">Also for this phase, we started from <span class="pop-text-1">the Reddit platform</span>, a network of communities based on people's interests, where registered users discuss various topics and upload content (links,
						post, images, videos).
						<br>Reddit is a huge world so we decided to focus on a smaller section, <span class="pop-text-1">the r/Subreddit</span>, an organization of content divided into boards that gathers, in one place, all the related material about different
						topics, normally created by users.
						<br>Elsagate phenomenon was originally reported on its dedicated Subreddit, from parents who noticed <span class="pop-text-1">inappropriate kid content</span> on Youtube.
						<br><br>We decided to get our material right from there, since, still today, it represents a powerful way to report <span class="pop-text-1">misleading contents</span>.
						<br>Clicking on the r/elsagate we got access to all the reports from the users who joined that subreddit. Here, people publish mainly screens of problematic channels or dangerous videos.</p>

					<h1 class="subtitle-about-b d-flex justify-content align-self">The dataset creation</h1>
					<p class="txt-about-b">We created a <span class="pop-text-1">dataset</span> with all the information we found useful such as videos authors, channels’ name, characters involved, <span class="pop-text-1">reported issue</span> in the footage and
						we created a short clip to summarize the problematic video.
						<br> These clips are gathered in the archive, whereas you can find the videos in the main page.
						<br><br>The number of posts related to the Elsagate phenomenon is pretty big, so we decided to center our analysis on <span class="pop-text-1">four symbolic characters</span>: Frozen Elsa, because her character gave name to the phenomenon
						we’re studying, Spiderman and superheroes, since there’s still a great interest for them, across children from different ages, Peppa Pig, because it’s a very popular cartoon among little kids and lastly, we chose Minecraft, since we
						thought it would be interesting to study content addressed to elder kids.
						<br>By choosing these four we also manage to cover almost all the audience’s ages: 2-4 years old, 5-8 and 9+, providing a sort of <span class="pop-text-1">scaled YouTube model<span>.<p>

					<h1 class="subtitle-about d-flex justify-content align-self">Why is this happening?</h1>
					<p class="txt-about">The reasons behind these videos are related to the revenue people or companies running these channels get from <span class="pop-text-1">views</span>;
						for each view obtained, more money is gained. Views are also important to determine the price of advertising slots, which often interrupt YouTube videos and appear to the watchers, just like tv spots. Studies demonstrate that 81% of children under the age of 11, use, more or less regularly, YouTube. Being this young audience so active, a huge quantity of content addressed to it is produced, <br>for a better chance to reach popularity.



						<h1 class="subtitle-about d-flex justify-content align-self">Yes but why “Elsa”?</h1>
						<p class="txt-about">Videos uploaded on YouTube are so many that the system does not manage to supervise them all. Content farm videos offer a great contribution to this huge flow and, among them, some are targeted to children and are also inappropriate. Under “inappropriate'' go all those videos that present shocking, repugnant, violent free of charge and obscene contents. In this scenario, in 2014, a dangerous phenomenon, later called “Elsagate”, started to spread. The term refers to all those inappropriate videos that exploit well known kids' characters (e.g. cartoons characters and heroes) to convey misleading content. <br> In 2014, a video titled <span class="pop-text-1">“Disney Princess Dolls Goes on a Date!"</span>was published and it featured Frozen’s Elsa as the protagonist, together with Ken and Spiderman dolls acting strangely, with veiled sexual references: it reached 37.384.055 views. From this moment on, this method has been extended to many other characters, but Elsa was the first one used with the purpose of attracting young viewers, giving the name to the phenomenon.

						<h1 class="subtitle-about d-flex justify-content align-self  ">Who’s behind the phenomenon?</h1>
						<p class="txt-about">At the moment it's almost impossible to figure out where these videos are coming from and who makes them: it could either be<span class="pop-text-1">teams of professional animators</span>as well as softwares that generates them randomly. Without knowing the sources, it is hard to prevent them from publishing these contents. What is clear though is the fact that those who produce them have for sure <span class="pop-text-1">economic reasons: </span>videos that reach high <span class="pop-text-1">numbers of views</span> <br> call the attention of advertisers, who see these media as an excellent monetizing source.
